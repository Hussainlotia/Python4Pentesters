# Python4Pentesters
Python can be the most powerful tool in your arsenal as it can be used to build almost any of the other penetration testing tools. The scope of this module does not allow us to go into too many details on Python. Still, I will cover several key areas that will be useful during engagements and help you better understand Python.

# Usage
